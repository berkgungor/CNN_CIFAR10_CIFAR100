# CNN_CIFAR10_CIFAR100

This repository provides CNN models with CIFAR 10 AND CIFAR 100 datasets while using TensorFlow Keras library.
Used layers:
- Conv2D
- Maxpool
- softmax
with relu activation.

Result of model extracts the accuracy and loss values along 50 epochs as well as with top-5 accuracy value.
